# Interaction and Perception User Study Experiment on Er-Bot

https://github.com/NAIST-SE/Er-Bot

This is an appendix package for the publication: **ChatBot for Compiler Error Messages:User Interaction and Perception**. This appendix consisting of experiment's raw data, including video recordings of experiment sessions, survey responses, chat log, and coding exercises used. 

## Abstract
A key hurdle that students face when first learning how to program is difficulty in interpreting compiler error messages. With the rise of bots that can support developers in various software engineering scenarios, we believe that there is an opportunity for bots to assist students in diagnosing and resolving their compiler error messages. Towards this goal, we carried out a user study and a thematic analysis to qualitatively explore how participants would interact with a chatbot. Interestingly, our participants treated the chatbot much like a search tool. Moreover, our results indicate that usersâ€™ interaction spans a wide range of queries from conceptual programming knowledge to very specific compiler error messages, and we also learned how satisfying they found the chatbot to be, from the perspective of functionality and user experience. We believe that our study has implications for chatbot designers, researchers, and students that are learning how to program.
