Exercise A: 
- Ask the user for a number from keyboard input. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
- Extras:
    - If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
    - Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check is divisible by num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

Exercise B: 
- Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

Exercise C: 
- Take two lists of integers, say for example these two:
	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Write this using at least one list comprehension.

Exercise D: 
- Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)
- Remember the rules:
    - Rock beats scissors
    - Scissors beats paper
    - Paper beats rock

Exercise E:
- Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate. (Hint: The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

Exercise F:
- Write a program (using function) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. 
- For example, if the input is " My name is Michele", then the program will return "Michele is name My".
